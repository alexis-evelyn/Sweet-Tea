# What Is Mazawalza
# Mazawalza is a magic based language for the lore of my game.
# As such, the concepts behind the characters will be geared toward spells and potions.
# Unlike Mincraft's random symbols with enchanting tables,
# I want these symbols to have meaning so that someone who puts the effort to learn to read it can understand what the spells and potions do.
