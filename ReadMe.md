This project is a result of me (Alex Evelyn) following tutorials to learn how to make games in Godot.

This game is inspired by Starbound and Undertale. I am not yet sure what I want to make the game into, hence the codename "Sweet Tea". Sweet Tea is my favorite drink, and working on this game helps a lot with my depression.

I fully intend for this to be a multiplayer compatible game and since I hear it is hard to add multiplayer to an existing game, I am building multiplayer support from the ground up.

* I want to add a third party authentication system (like through Steam or Discord), which will allow a unique id to be set for the client that cannot be modified by the user. This is to help protect server owners against people trying to circumvent bans. I haven't decided how I want this to be set up, yet.
